    Contrast &amp; Color

  %p Have a minimum of contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text.

  %p If you use color to indicate something, also use another indicator. For example, underline links on hover or mark a required field with an asterisk.

  %p Red/green color blindness is the most common, so avoid green on red.

  %p Include color names in product descriptions and show examples.

    Images

  %p Images without alt text are assumed by screen readers to be decorative, which is ok if they are indeed decorative! (Like background color images, etc). You can also use alt=’’ to instruct screenreaders to skip decorative images.

  %h3 Alt text
  %p Pay attention to context. Describe the function, not the content.

  %h3 Background, Decorative Images
  %img{:src => "http://s4.wallippo.com/thumbs/100000/geometric-abstract-wallpaper-2-16-10-1f355522032c3c585e95716ea6e13941.jpeg", :alt => "", :height => ""}/
  %p Alt tag: ""
  %p This image is completely skipped by a screenreader.
  
  %h3 Regular Images that Convey Information, Supplement Content
  %p In general though, alternate text describes pictorial content in words.
  .image-grid
    .image-item 
      %img{:src => "http://www.bearded.com/images/bearded-logo.svg", :alt => "Bearded - Home"}/ 
      %p Possible alt tags: "Bearded - Home", "Home", "Bearded Logo"
      %p It is a good idea here, when you have a logo on every page of the site, to state the Logo Name and where it redirects to on the site if clicked on.
    .image-item 
      %img{:src => "http://www.bearded.com/images/phone-1.png", :alt => "Mobile phone web page of cyber security website about eavesdropping."}/
      %p Possible alt tags: "Mobile phone web page of cyber security website about eavesdropping", "Mobile web page about cyber security"
      %p The extent and detail of your alt text comes down to how much information the image is relaying to sighted readers.  If the image is integral to the content, the alt tag should be equally expressive. 
    .image-item 
      %img{:src => 'http://file.nekogazou.ni-moe.com/Img/1426582542/', :alt => "Cat rolled up in a piece of paper"}/
      %p Possible alt tags: "Cat rolled up in a piece of paper", "Cute cat picture"
      %p Alt tags are also important for sighted readers.  If your image path ever changes, your alt tag will still show up on the page, and no loss of information will occur.

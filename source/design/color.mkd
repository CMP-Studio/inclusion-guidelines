## Contrast & Color

Find colors that provide maximum contrast, including enough contrast between content and the background, so that text and non-decorative images are legible for anyone with low vision or color deficiencies.

### Best Practices
* **Ratio:** Text and interactive elements should have a color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
* **Color as indicator:** Color should not be the only indicator for interactive elements. For example, underline links on hover, or mark a required field with an asterisk.
* **Color blindness:** Red/green color blindness is the most common, so avoid green on red or red on green. (Think especially about avoiding using red and green for "bad" and "good" indicators).

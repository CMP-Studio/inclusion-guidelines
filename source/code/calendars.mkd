## Calendars

On most museum websites, it seems like there are two general types of calendars:

1. An inline list generated view of events which you can filter by clicking on a month (which generally is a link or button).

2. A table-based calendar that filters events by clicking on a certain day or month.

### Best Practices

#### Inline Calendar

* Sometimes a table might not be the best option for users of all abilities to filter for a date or time period. Consider instead having a heading that clearly states: 'Filter by month,' and then the different buttons to filter by month or week available directly below that.

* Also, make sure you add a proper heading to each result. Many screen readers have the functionality to tell a user what different headings or links are on the page, and the ability to use that function would probably make a user's experience that much easier.

#### Table Based Calendar

* Refer to our table section for best practices.

* Think about if your calendar can be presented differently, and if a table truly is the best way for users of all abilities, to select a date or time period.

* Here are a few calendars tools which claim to be accessible, but we have not tested yet:

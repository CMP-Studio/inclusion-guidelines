## Carousels

Carousels are all over the web. Websites often use them to try to promote a few different pieces of content as a center piece. However, research has been done which shows users don't really interact with carousels! Oftentimes, carousels are simply way to compromise on what is the most important piece of content for the page--allowing you to promote multiple different things (that the user then doesn't generally interact with).

Be careful when using carousels. Use them for their intended purpose -- to display multiple pieces of content. Don't just use a carousel to compromise on what's the most important piece of content and to placate all stakeholders. As the Nielsen Norman nicely summarizes:

"[I]f you are using a carousel in the hopes that people will see a variety of content, know that some people will only see the first frame or none at all. So ensure that important content is also placed mindfully in the [Information Architecture] and on another page of your site. Consider using a static carousel or hero image instead of a rotating one. And in any carousel's navigation, ensure the buttons and links are clear, large enough to decipher and click, and the selected frame's button appears selected".

In terms of accessibility, carousels really aren't great. To a visually impaired person, they are rapidly changing images which are controlled by an often arbitrary or non-existent set of buttons. If these images are presenting the most important content on your website, consider using something, well, more accessible, and that's not relaying content through an image.

### Best Practice

Much of the following best practices are adapted from Gian Wild's article ["The Unbearable Inaccessibility of Slideshows."](https://www.sitepoint.com/unbearable-accessible-slideshow/)

* Provide a pause button and do NOT use autoplay (this can cause seizures).

* All slideshow/carousel navigation and pause/play buttons must be keyboard accessible and have adequate color/contrast ratios.

* Also make sure the hover and focus states are visibly obvious.

* Provide an alternative to the content in the slideshow (especially the content that is on slides other than the first).

* Give elements in a slideshow a clear focus order (meaning you will either make the html fall in the correct order, or add different tabindex values to dictate the tabbing order).

* Include 5 or fewer elements in the carousel (suggested by Nielsen Norman Group).

* Tell the user how many slides there are, and where they are in that slideshow.

We will include further practices we think can make this example carousel even more accessible. (Making controls accessible to a screen reader?)
